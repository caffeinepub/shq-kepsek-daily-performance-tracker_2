  "summary": "Backend adds an admin-only API to save a School for an arbitrary principal, and frontend adds an edit dialog + React Query mutation to update by principal with cache invalidation. However, the backend also appears to have changed the existing saveSchool authorization to admin-only, which was not requested and may violate the no-regressions requirement for existing school-save flows.",

      "description": "Changed existing saveSchool(school) behavior to be admin-only (traps non-admin callers), which was not requested and may break existing Kepsek/profile setup flows.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest only asks for a new admin-only API for updating a school for an arbitrary principal (REQ-15) and explicitly requires existing useSaveSchool() behavior to remain unchanged (REQ-17 AC). The diff shows saveSchool now checks AccessControl.isAdmin and traps otherwise.",
