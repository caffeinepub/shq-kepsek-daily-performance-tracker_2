  "summary": "The diff only updates project_state.json to record the requests as pending; it does not add the required static logo assets or update any frontend components/pages to use branding constants for the new logo.",

      "requirement": "Create/replace the static branding assets derived from the uploaded logo image (ee.png) and store them under frontend/public/assets/generated using the exact filenames: shq-kepsek-icon.dim_512x512.png (512x512) and shq-kepsek-logo.dim_1024x256.png (1024x256).",
      "reason": "No files were added under frontend/public/assets/generated; the only modified file is project_state.json, so the required image assets are not created/replaced.",

      "requirement": "Ensure the new logo is displayed consistently (and the old logo is fully replaced) on AppHeader, AdminDashboardPage, KepsekDashboardPage, and LoginPage by relying on centralized branding constants (frontend/src/constants/branding.ts) and removing remaining hardcoded/legacy logo paths.",
      "reason": "No frontend source files (e.g., AppHeader/Login/Dashboards/branding constants) were modified; only project_state.json was changed, so the logo replacement and cleanup cannot be implemented.",
